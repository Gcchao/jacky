    cost that free you from the headache.</p>

<p>Don’t have manufacturing experience? We can help! 
We are working very close with startup companies who doesn’t have 
manufacturing experience, and we help them to resolve all production
 issues, such as lead-time issues, design issues, material purchasing, 
 and manufacturing issues.</p>

<p>What is the different between Paritron and other CMS?
The reason customers trust Paritron is because customers know 
Paritron is representing for them, not CMS. Paritron’s priority is
 to help our customer success first; therefore, we always try our best
  to support our customers by providing better price, best quality, 
  and shorter lead-time.  At Paritron, we have our own quality systems,
   which is significantly higher in standard compares to other CMS. 
   Usually, the CM does not verify the Quality Assurance for every 
   production that runs overseas; however, it is by Paritron. Our
    team will fly to China for every project that is manufactured in
     China to verify the quality to ensure the products we exceed
      quality guidelines. </p>
